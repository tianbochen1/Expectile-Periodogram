# Expectile-Periodogram

This repo introduces a novel periodogram-like function, called the expectile periodogram, for modeling spectral features of time series. The expectile periodogram is constructed from trigonometric expectile regression, in which a specially designed cost function is used to substitute the squared $l_2$ norm that leads to the ordinary periodogram. The expectile periodogram retains the key properties of the ordinary periodogram as a frequency-domain representation of serial dependence in time series, while offering a more comprehensive understanding by examining the data across the entire range of expectile levels.
